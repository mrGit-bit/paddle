# 1️⃣ Project Purpose

Full-stack Django web application for managing:

- Padel match tracking
- Hall of Fame rankings
- Player statistics
- Americano tournaments

This repository contains TWO products:

1. Django Web App (primary product)
2. Android Mobile Wrapper (Capacitor WebView)

There is no duplicated business logic in the mobile app.

---

# 2️⃣ Architecture Overview

## Backend

- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Session authentication
- Oracle Autonomous DB (staging / production)
- SQLite (development)

## Frontend

- Django Templates (NOT React)
- Bootstrap 5
- Minimal vanilla JavaScript
- No frontend framework

## Mobile

- Capacitor (Android)
- WebView loads production or staging URL
- No duplicated backend logic

---

# 3️⃣ Critical Architectural Rules (FOR AI AGENTS)

These rules must NEVER be violated.

## Version Source of Truth

Runtime version is defined ONLY in:

    paddle/config/__init__.py

Example:

    __version__ = "1.3.0"

Rules:

- CHANGELOG.md is documentation only.
- `[Unreleased]` must always remain at the top of CHANGELOG.md.
- The About page reads version from `config.__version__`.
- Never parse version from CHANGELOG.md.
- Never infer version from Git tags inside runtime code.

---

## Ranking Logic

- All ranking computation lives in:

    paddle/frontend/services/ranking.py

- Main function:

    compute_ranking(scope)

Rules:

- Do NOT move ranking logic into templates.
- Do NOT duplicate ranking computation.
- Templates must render precomputed `display_*` fields.

---

## Views Rules

- Views must remain thin.
- No heavy computation inside views.
- No business logic in templates.
- Use PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) for POST handling.

---

## Templates Rules

- Templates must not compute logic.
- Only display values passed via context.
- No ranking calculations in templates.

---

# 4️⃣ Branching Model

- develop → integration
- staging → pre-production
- main → production

Rules:

- No direct commits to main.
- Release flow defined in RELEASE.md.
- CI must pass before merging to staging or main.
