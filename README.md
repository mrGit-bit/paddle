# 🏆 Paddle Tennis Hall of Fame

## 📖 Overview

Paddle Tennis Hall of Fame is a web application that allows users to manage a "Hall of Fame" for a group of friends playing paddle tennis in their tennis club.

Registered users can keep track of matches played, update their match results, view player rankings and get some player stats.

This is a web application built using:

- Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF) to build a RESTful API.

- Django templates for the HTML pages, JavaScript for interactivity in those pages, and Bootstrap for styling.

### ✨ Key Features & Implementation

#### Hall of Fame Rankings

- Displays a ranked list of paddle tennis players based on the number of matches won.
- Accessible to anyone (unauthenticated users).
- **Implementation**:
  - The `PlayerViewSet` in `views.py` enables viewing players. Player ranking is achieved by ordering the queryset by the `wins` field.
  - The `PlayerSerializer` uses `SerializerMethodField` to calculate dynamic fields like `matches_played`, `losses`, and `win_rate`.

#### Match Results

- Allows registered users to add results for matches (two teams, each with two players) and update results for matches they've played.
- Automatically creates new players if they don't already exist.
- **Implementation**:
  - The `MatchSerializer` includes logic to accept player names, create new players if needed, and avoid player duplicates.
  - `perform_create()` in the `MatchViewSet` ensures match creation updates player stats dynamically.
  - The `perform_update()` method resets old match stats before applying new results to ensure correctness.

#### User Management

- When a new user is being created, the user can choose to link with an existing player. When not linked to any player, the user is added as a new player with stats set to zero, and the player's name will be the username. If player is linked, the user assumes the stats of the player, and the player's name is changed to be the username.
- **Implementation**:
  - The `UserSerializer` includes a `player_id` field for the above mentioned optional linking with an existing non-registered player.
  - The `UserViewSet` ensures users can only update or delete their own profiles (unless the user is an admin).

#### Player Details

- Provides detailed profiles for each player, including a list of matches played and player stats like wins, matches played, number of matches played, win rate, and losses. Only admin users can update or delete players details.
- **Implementation**:
  - The `PlayerSerializer` includes dynamically calculated fields: `matches_played`, `losses`, and `win_rate`.
  - The `PlayerViewSet` restricts modification of player profiles to admin users.

#### Authentication & Permissions

- Non-registered users can only view:
  - Hall of Fame;
  - register; and,
  - login.  

- Registered users can also:
  - add match results;
  - update or delete their own match results;
  - review and update their own profile;
  - view player stats.
  
- Admin users can do anything, including creating, updating, and deleting matches,  players and users.

- **Implementation**:
  - DRF's built-in session authentication is used.
  - The `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` permission class allows non-registered users to view player rankings.
  - The `IsAuthenticated` permission class ensures match-related actions are restricted to authenticated users.
- Registered users can login and logout using the provided endpoints.
- **Implementation**:
  - Authenticate users using session-based authentication.
  - The `LoginView` and `LogoutView` API endpoints handle user authentication and logout.

## 📡 API Endpoints

All API endpoints follow the [RESTful API design](https://restfulapi.net/) principles.

### Endpoints for the `games` app

The `games` app manages both players and matches.

`/api/games/players/`:

- `GET` Provides access to the **Hall of Fame** with a ranked list of all players. Open to anyone.
- `POST` Creates a new player. Is Admin only.

`/api/games/players/<id>/`:

- `GET` Provides detailed information about a specific player. Only authenticated users can access it.
- `PUT` & `PATCH` Updates a player's information. Admin only.
- `DELETE` Deletes a player. Admin only.

`/api/games/matches/`:

- `GET` Allows registered users to access the form for adding matches and viewing match history.
- `POST` Allows registered users to add matches by creating new ones. Also players are created if they don't already exist.

`/api/games/matches/<id>/`:

- `PUT` & `PATCH` Allows editing of match details, restricted to authorized users of that match.
- `DELETE` Deletes a match. Restricted to authorized users of that match.

### Endpoints for the `users` app

Manages user registration, login, logout, linking of existing non-registered players, and user profiles management.

`/api/users/`:

- `POST` Allows new users to register. Open to anyone.

`/api/users/<id>/`:

- `GET` View the user's own profile.
- `PUT` & `PATCH` Update a user's profile. Only the owner of the profile can.
- `DELETE` Delete a user's profile. Only the owner of the profile can.

### Endpoints for the `api-auth` browsable API

In development, the `api-auth` app provides endpoints for login and logout for the browsable API.

`/api-auth/login/`: Login endpoint for the browsable API.

`/api-auth/logout/`: Logout endpoint for the browsable API.

## 🌐 Frontend Pages

The frontend provides the following endpoints to load different pages:

- `/`: Hall of Fame (ranked list of players).
- `/matches/`: adding match results and match history.
- `/register/`: user registration.
- `/login/`: user login using Django's built-in authentication.
- `/players/<id>/`: player details, match history and stats.
- `/users/<id>/`: editing user details.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="#index">Back to Index</a></div>

## 🛠️ JavaScript functionalities

- `passwordValidation.js`: Checks if the password and confirm password fields match, and displays dynamically an error message if they don't. Is used in `register.html`.
- `playerLabelUpdater.js`: The label of the player input field updates dynamically as the user types, based on the input value to distinguish between registered players, existing players, and new players in the form fields of `match.html`.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="#index">Back to Index</a></div>

## 🧪 Testing

The project comes with a suite of tests for the `games`, `users` and `frontend` apps. The tests can be run using the `pytest` command.

These are the files for testing:

- `games/tests/test_permissions.py`
- `games/tests/test_players.py`
- `games/tests/test_stats.py`
- `users/tests/test_authentication.py`
- `users/tests/test_permissions.py`
- `users/tests/test_register.py`
- `frontend/test_frontend.py`

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Starting from the simplest to the more complex features:

### **Match model**

- Modify the match model in `games/models.py` to support the new fields: `created_at`, `updated_at` and `created_by`.

### **User Management**

- **Allow New Users to Link with More Than One Non-Registered Player**:
  - Users can link their accounts with multiple non-registered players' assuming their stats by adding their outcomes, allowing seamless integration of historical data.
  - **Implementation Note**: Modify the player model and user registration workflow to support multiple link to several players.

- **Allow Users to Change/Reset Their Passwords**:
  - Provide options for users to update their passwords or initiate a reset if they forget.
  - **Implementation Note**: Use Django's built-in authentication and password reset views, with an email service to send reset links.

### **Security**

- **Allow Social Authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)**:
  - Let users sign up or log in using third-party authentication services.
  - **Implementation Note**: Integrate `django-allauth` to add social authentication options.

### **Frontend Enhancements**

- **Move the Frontend from MPA (Multi-Page Application) to SPA (Single-Page Application) with React**:
  - Transition the frontend to React for a more dynamic user experience, improved navigation, and more modern UI interactions.
  - **Implementation Note**: Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to provide a backend API and React for the frontend, ensuring the separation of concerns.

### **User Experience**

- **Integrate User Profiles with Randomized Images for Player Avatars**:
  - Assign randomized avatar images to players for a more personalized and visually engaging profile.
  - **Implementation Note**: Use an avatar generation API (e.g., `https://avatars.dicebear.com`) or a default set of local images to choose from in case the API is not available.

- **Add a Reel Video in the Background of the Hall of Fame Loading Page**:
  - Include a short video or animated loop in the Hall of Fame page background to enhance visual appeal.
  - **Implementation Note**: Use a lightweight video format to prevent slowing down page loading. Consider lazy loading or conditional playback for mobile devices.
